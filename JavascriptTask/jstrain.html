    <p>1. Scenario: You're developing a website for a clothing store. Depending on the weather, you want to display different messages on the homepage. 
        Write a JavaScript conditional statement using logical operators to display "Stay warm with our winter collection!" if the temperature is below 10 
        degrees Celsius, "Enjoy the sunshine with our summer collection!" if the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius, and "Check out our all-season collection!" 
        for temperatures in between.</p>
